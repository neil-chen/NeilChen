/**
 * @defgroup sql Query Builder
 * Privatemsg does use its own simple query builder which allows to extend
 * SELECT-Queries in an easy way. The function _privatemsg_assemble_query
 * creates the query, based on an array $fragments with the following content.
 * Except primary_table, each key is an array itself to allow multiple values
 *
 *  - primary_table: The main table to select from
 *  - select: The fields that should be selected. This can be a simple field, a
 *    field with alias or even a subquery.
 *  - inner_join: The tables that should be joined. This is not specific to
 *    inner joins.
 *    Example: INNER JOIN pm_index pmi ON (pmi.mid = pm.mid)
 *  - where: The where conditions. The conditions are always AND, but it is
 *    possible to use OR inside a condition.
 *    Example: ⁽pmi.is_new = 1 OR pmi.deleted = 1)
 *  - order_by: Order By values, example: pm.timestamp ASC
 *  - query_args: It is possible to use the placeholders like %s in each part of
 *    the query. The values of query_args are then inserted into these.
 *    query_args consists of three arrays (join, where, having), one for each
 *    key that currently supports arguments.
 *
 * Use _privatemsg_assemble_query
 *
 * The privatemsg_assemble_query function takes a query_id as first argument
 * and optionally one or multiple arguments. query_id can either be a
 * string ('some_id') or an array('group_name', 'query_id'), if a string
 * is supplied, group_name defaults to 'privatemsg'. Returned is an array
 * with the keys 'query' (normal query) and 'count' (count query for pager).
 *
 * For the actual query data, the function group_name_sql_query_id is executed,
 * this functions does have $fragments as first parameter and then the
 * optional parameters.
 *
 * A short example:
 * @code
 * // First, create the sql function.
 * function privatemsg_sql_getsubject(&$fragments, $mid, $uid) {
 *   // Set the primary table.
 *   $fragments['primary_table'] = '{pm_message} pm';
 *
 *   // Add a field.
 *   $fragments['select'][] = 'pm.subject';
 *
 *   // Join another table
 *   $fragment['inner_join'][] = 'INNER JOIN {pm_index} pi ON (pi.mid = pm.mid AND pi.uid = %d)';
 *   $fragment['query_args']['join'][] $uid;
 *
 *   // And finally add a condition.
 *   $fragments['where'][] = 'pm.mid = %d';
 *   $fragments['query_args']['where'][] = $mid;
 * }
 *
 * // Now we can use that query everywhere.
 * $query = _privatemsg_assemble_query('getsubject', 5);
 * $result = db_query($query['query']);
 * @endcode
 * Extend existing queries
 *
 * To extend a privatemsg query, use hook_group_name_sql_query_id_alter.
 * This hook does use the same parameters as the sql function.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * function mymodule_privatemsg_sql_getsubject_alter(&$fragments, $mid) {
 * // we want to load the body too..
 *  $fragments['select'][] = 'pm.body';
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * - List of sql query hooks.
 *  - list: List of messages, Parameters: $fragments, $accounty
 *  - list_sent: List of sent messages, Parameters: $fragments, $accounty
 *  - load: Load a single message, Parameters: $fragments, $pmid, $account
 *  - messages: Load the messages of a thread,
 *    Parameters: $fragments, $thread_id, $account
 *  - autocomplete: Searching usernames for the autocomplete feature,
 *    Parameters: $fragments, $search, $names
 *  - participants: Loads all participants of a thread,
 *    Parameters: $fragments, $thread_id
 *  - unread_count: Number of unread messages for a user,
 *    Parameters: $fragments, $account
 *
 * - The following query_id's are used in pm_block_user
 *  - threadautors: Return all authors of one or multiple threads,
 *    Parameters: $fragments, $threads

/**
 * @defgroup types Types of recipients
 *
 * It is possible to define other types of recipients than the usual single
 * user. These types are defined through a hook and a few callbacks and are
 * stored in the {pm_index} table for each recipient entry.
 *
 * Because of that, only the combination of type and recipient (was uid in older
 * versions) defines a unique recipient.
 *
 * This feature is usually used to define groups of recipients. Privatemsg
 * comes with the privatemsg_roles sub-module, which allows to send messages to
 * all members of a specific group.
 *
 * When sending a new message with a recipient type other than user, Privatemsg
 * only inserts a single entry for that recipient type. However, when looking
 * for messages for a user, Privatemsg only looks for recipient types user and
 * hidden. To fill the gap, Privatemsg defines three ways how a non-user
 * type is converted to hidden recipient entries.
 *
 * - For small recipient types (by default <100 recipients, configurable), the
 *   entries are added directly after saving the original private message.
 * - When sending messages through the UI, bigger recipient types are handled
 *   with batch API.
 * - For messages sent by the API, the hidden recipients are generated during
 *   cron runs.
 *
 * Once all hidden recipients are added, the original recipient type is marked
 * as read so Privatemsg knows that he has been processed.
 *
 * Privatemsg defines the following types:
 *
 * - user: This is the default recipient type which is used for a single user.
 * - hidden: Used to add internal recipient entries for other recipient types.
 * - role: The sub-module privatemsg_roles defines an additional type called
 *   role. This allows to send messages to all members of a role.
 *
 * To implement a new type, the following hooks need to be implemented. Note
 * that most of these hooks can also be used alone for other functionality than
 * defining recipient types.
 *
 * - hook_privatemsg_recipient_type_info() - Tell Privatemsg about your
 *   recipient type(s).
 * - hook_privatemsg_name_lookup() - Convert a string to an
 *   recipient object
 *
 * Additionaly, there is also a hook_privatemsg_recipient_type_info_alter() that
 * allows to alter recipient type definitions.
